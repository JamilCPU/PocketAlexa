- "lock screen" - Locks the computer screen/desktop
- "play media" - Plays or resumes media playback (music, video, etc.)
- "pause media" - Pauses media playback

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the input text for intent and meaning, not just exact word matches
2. Consider common speech variations, synonyms, and natural language patterns
